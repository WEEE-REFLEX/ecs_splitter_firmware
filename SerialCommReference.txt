each command is followed by a LF character '\n'

from PC to controller
PX<SS><float>: set positions of the splitter at X = <float>; e.g. XA2.34 --> place the 1st splitter at position X = 2.34
PY<SS><float>: guess what...
HB<T|F>: will ask for ACK at every command
SSS: motor hard stop
HHH: motor soft stop
Q<X|Y><SS>: query motor position X or Y or both position; e.g. QXA --> the controller should return RXA2.34
QQX: query all X motor positions; e.g. the controller will burst all RXA2.34	RXB1.73    RXC3.47
QQY: query all Y motor positions
QQQ: query all positions

from controller to PC	
R<X|Y><SS><float>: motor <SS> has <X|Y> position <float>; e.g. RXC3.47 --> the 3rd motor is in X position 3.47
ACK: generic acknownledge from controller
E<error_type><SS>
I<info_type><SS>

error_type = {U: unreachable, L: got lost :-)}
info_type = {H: halted, S: stopped, O: overcurrent, R: reset to zero position}
